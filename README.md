# RSS-Feed-app
Simple app that allows users to add RSS feeds and see posts from feeds.
Lets users enable and disable feeds that are on the 'frontpage' or watch from individual feeds.

Uses NSXMLParser to parse downloaded XML and present it to users. 
Requires iOS 9+ as the code uses SFSafariViewController to show content when an item is selected.

Classes ```Feed```, ```FeedItem```, ```FeedManager``` and ```FeedParser``` can be used for parsing RSS feeds.

Feel free to use the code for whatever you want.
